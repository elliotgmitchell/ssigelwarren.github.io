    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>
      [Insert your 200-word bio here. This should describe your background, education, approach to dramaturgy, 
      and notable productions or collaborations. Consider including your theatrical philosophy and what makes 
      your approach unique.]
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A good bio might include details about your theatrical training, special areas of expertise 
      (such as specific historical periods, genres, or cultural traditions), languages you work with, 
      and the types of productions you've supported. You could also mention any teaching experience, 
      publications, or awards.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The bio should give potential collaborators a sense of your personality, working style, and the 
      value you bring to productions as a dramaturge and creative consultant.
